# Xenon - The interpreted interpreted programming language
## INTRO

This is the programming intro to Xenon.
This is an extra credit project for PLC - (Programming language Concepts).

The language was built in python to allow simplicty of syntax and will incorperate my favorite
things about javascript such as some keywords and/or syntax. There is an intro file you can start
playing with and this is found at [test.xenon]
